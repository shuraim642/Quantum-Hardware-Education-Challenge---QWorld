# Quantum-Hardware-Education-Challenge---QWorld
Womanium Quantum Hackathon 2022


# Module Name: QGold
## Team Name: Supremacy

### Team Members:
 - Muhammad Shuraim
 - Arpi Kundu
 - Nikhil Tiwari
 - Monika

## Our Plan:
In this module, we have tried to document the physical realization of Qubit kind and the Quantum Operations/Gates to process information. We have considered the following kinds of qubits to delineates the physical realization. 

[Physical Realization of Qubits](Physical_Realization_of_Qubits.ipynb)&nbsp;

1) Superconducting Quantum Computers
2) Photonics Quantum Computing

[Physical Realization of Quantum Logical Operation](Physical_Realization_of_Operations.ipynb)

1) NOT Gate
2) Phase Gate
3) Hadamard Gate
4) Controlled NOT Gate

The main aim behind this is just to make the studnets of Quantum Computing, well aquainted with what qubits and gates looks like in the physical sense. The whole aim is behind this is just a pedagogical manner. The pre-requisites for our module "QGold" are following:

* **Pre-Requisites of this module:**
    - High School Physics and Mathematics
    - QBronze
    - QSilver
    - Quantum Mechanics-I (overview not mathematically deep)
    - Electronic Circuit Designs (for Superconducting Quantum Computing)
    - Polarization Optics (for Photonics Quantum Computing)

## Yet-To-Be-Done Task:
Of course as always, there is a larger list of yet-to-be-done than what have we done yet. We are considering to expand this module to further Quantum Computers with the pedagogical perspectives to make the students/enthusiats of Quantum Computing Technology, well familiarized and to tell the students what qubits are represented in Hilbert Space is actually mapping something in real time and space. Following are the Quantum Computers to which we want to expand our module:
 - Trapped Ion Quantum Computers
 - Silicon Quantum Dots
 - Neutral Atom Quantum Computers

Following are the Quantum Logical/illogical operations/Gates which we want to include further in this module but due shortage of time, we coudn't complete it:
 - Pauli X
 - Pauli Y
 - Pauli Z
 - Toffoli Gate
 - Etc.
