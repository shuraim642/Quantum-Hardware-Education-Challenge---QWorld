# Quantum-Hardware-Education-Challenge---QWorld
Womanium Quantum Hackathon 2022


# Module Name: QGold
## Team Name: Supremacy

### Team Members:
 - Muhammad Shuraim
 - Arpi Kundu
 - Nikhil Tiwari
 - Monika

## Our Plan:
In this module, we have tried to document the physical realization of Qubit kind and the Quantum Operations/Gates to process information. We have considered the following kinds of qubits to delineates the physical realization. 

[Physical Realization of Qubits](Physical_Realization_of_Qubits.ipynb)&nbsp;

1) Superconducting Quantum Computers
2) Photonics Quantum Computing

[Physical Realization of Quantum Logical Operation](Physical_Realization_of_Operations.ipynb)

1) NOT Gate
2) Phase Gate
3) Hadamard Gate
4) Controlled NOT Gate

The main aim behind this is just to make the studnets of Quantum Computing, well aquainted with what qubits and gates looks like in the physical sense. The whole aim is behind this is just a pedagogical manner. The pre-requisites for our module "QGold" are following:

* **Pre-Requisites of this module:**
    - High School Physics and Mathematics
    - QBronze
    - QSilver
    - Quantum Mechanics-I (overview not mathematically deep)
    - Electronic Circuit Designs (for Superconducting Quantum Computing)
    - Polarization Optics (for Photonics Quantum Computing)
